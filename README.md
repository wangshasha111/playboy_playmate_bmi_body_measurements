# playboy_playmate_bmi_body_measurements
 
## Goals

This project aims to examine the bmi, body measurements, and body measurement ratios of the Playboy Playmates for years 1953-2020. 

## Background

The Playboy Playmate is a distinctive feature of Playboy magazine, introduced by Hugh Hefner in 1953, marking the beginning of the iconic publication. Each month, Playboy selects a woman to be its Playmate of the Month, gracing the centerfold with a tastefully nude pictorial. These Playmates are chosen for their beauty, charm, and personality, and they often become celebrities in their own right. Being selected as a Playboy Playmate can launch a modeling or acting career and provides a platform for women to express their sensuality and confidence. The Playmate concept represents a blend of art, culture, and sexuality, contributing to Playboy's enduring status as a symbol of sophistication and adult entertainment. Over the years, numerous Playmates have gone on to achieve fame in various fields, making the title a cultural phenomenon that extends beyond the pages of the magazine.

## Data collection


I manually collected the data from the internet by looking into the playmates' Wikipedia and/or taking from other web pages, including:

## Data cleaning

The raw data is cleaned to be [output/playmate.dta](https://github.com/wangshasha111/playboy_playmate_bmi_body_measurements/blob/main/output/playmate.dta) containing the models' body measurements and time.

## Outputs

The primary outputs are three graphs depicting the time sequence of 

1. the weight, height, and BMI of the models; [(playmate_fit_bmi_height_weight.png)](https://github.com/wangshasha111/playboy_playmate_bmi_body_measurements/blob/main/output/playmate_fit_bmi_height_weight.png)
2. the measurement of the bust, the waist, and the hips of the models; [(playmate_measurement.png)](https://github.com/wangshasha111/playboy_playmate_bmi_body_measurements/blob/main/output/playmate_measurement.png)
3. the ratio-related measurement of the models; [(playmate_ratio.png)](https://github.com/wangshasha111/playboy_playmate_bmi_body_measurements/blob/main/output/playmate_ratio.png)


## Takeaway
There are three takeaways of the project pertaining to the three projects respectively.

1. The average BMI has been decreasing steadily and the height has been increasing steadily.
2. The average bust-waist-hips measurement shows that the typical body shape of the models is becoming more and more **stick-thin**.
3. The ratio-related measurement shows that the body shapes are becoming less and less **feminine**, i.e., with cupsize decreasing, waist-to-bust and waist-to-hips ratios both increasing.
